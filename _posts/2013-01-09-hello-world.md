I got a blog.

{% highlight java linenos %}
class FirstPost {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

After a long time of dragging my feet, I finally have a personal site! My good friend [Andrew Capshaw](http://capshaw.me "Andrew's personal site") who is a gifted designer gave me permission to fork his site which has allowed me to have a very good looking page. This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) which uses [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) if you're interested in getting a similar setup. I look forward to posting updates on what I'm doing, my interests, and whatever else I have time for.
