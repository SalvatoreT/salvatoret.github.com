My name is Salvatore, but you can call me Sal. During the day, I'm a software engineer at [Persona](https://withpersona.com/), working on the web and mobile SDKs.

In the evenings, I perform, produce, and direct improv comedy, predominately with [Endgames Improv](http://endgamesimprov.com/) and sketch comedy with [Killing My Lobster](https://www.killingmylobster.com/).
